ADVANCED GROUP CI/CD PIPELINE PROJECT

Provision your Jenkins CI server using terraform 

Allow terraform to have an output.tf file that will make the ip address for the provisioned Jenkins CI server to be made available to you 

SSH to Jenkins server and add visudo permission privileges to Jenkins user 

Checker whether Jenkins user exist            sudo cat /etc/passwd  or sudo tail -5 /etc/passwd 

 If not 

Add Jenkins user - sudo useradd jenkins 

Switch to Jenkins user - sudo su jenkins (we will have two users)  vs sudo su - jenkins ( fully switch to jenkins) 

Add jenkins user to docker Group - to see the logs of jenkins in the docker console/ and also be able to run docker commands - sudo usermod -a -G docker jenkins or sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins
How to view the jenkins logs in Docker 
# sudo docker logs -f [container ID]

Run a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins CI server. 

Git source code link to use in the jenkins CI Server: https://github.com/joshking1/spring-boot-mongo-docker.git 

Use very few plugins/downloads and if possible, none. The aim of this project is to write a declarative pipeline script to do the job for you. 

PLUGINS 

	Docker plugins/dependencies/downloads 

	Kubernetes continuous deploy plugin - (Main purpose  of this plugin is to store the Google Kubernetes Cluster (GKC) credentials (config credentials)
	The current jenkins kubernetes continous deploy plugin is 2.3.1 version.  
	Running the deploy (manifests) with the 2.3.1 version is going to fail all the time. 
	Why? This is because GKC and other clusters, such KOPS, EKS, KUBEADM (bare metal), Linode cluster do not recognize the version 2.3.1
	
	Solution - downgrade the kubernetes continuous deploy plugin from versiuon 2.3.1 to version 1.0.0
	
	Go to manage jenkins ==> manage plugins ==> Advanced (upload the downgraded kubernetes continuous deploy)  and will be downloaded as usual 

	Google kubernetes engine plugin - this is because were deploying in the GKC

SPECIAL COMMAND TO RUN BEFORE CREATING THE DECLARATIVE PIPELINE SCRIPT 

Link: https://github.com/joshking1/Commands_Devop_Pipeline.git ( All the commands are available in this link) 

# Update visudo and assign administration privileges to jenkins user

	sudo vi /etc/sudoers 
	jenkins ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL 
	sudo useradd jenkins 
	sudo su - jenkins  
	
# Install Docker	sudo yum install docker.io    ==> (Amazon linux VMware) 
	docker --version

# Add jenkins user to Docker group
	sudo usermod -a -G docker jenkins or sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins
	
# Install and Setup Kubectl ( why?) ==>  to be able to apply kubectl commands on the cluster ( Kubectl is the cluster command line interface) 

For people who selected to work with GKC, it is not a must to install the kubectl CLI in your jenkins terminal because you have the google kubernetes engine plugins in your jenkins console 

Commands to install Kubectl CLI 

curl -LO "https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
	
	chmod +x ./kubectl 
	
	sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin
	
# Verify the kubectl installation

	kubectl version
	
	==> should display complete and the version of the kubectl CLI
	
STEPS TO SUCCESSFULLY WRITE AND RUN THE DECLARATIVE PIPELINE SCRIPT WITH GIT, GITHUB, DOCKER & MAVEN INTERGRATION 

Write a declarative Jenkins pipeline script to integrate the necessary tools such as docker, maven etc and include the following stages in your Jenkins build: 

STAGE 1 

Git Clone (try both scm checkout and git:Git pipeline syntax solutions) 

In the company, you will work with a private git repository. 

You must provide credentials for the GitHub (username and password) and ID which jenkins will use to locate the GIT credentials. An example of such an ID is GIT_HUB_CREDENTIAL

Maven clean build and package (integrate Jenkins with maven to enhance the compilation gathering of the source code), linkage (linking of different files in the source code), packaging, testing, and the building of the Java artifact) ==> (store the Java artifact in the preferred artifactory)

Docker build (build docker image using docker file in your src git repository url ) ==> src is the short form of source code 

Docker tag (create a repo in the docker hub, give your image appropriate name and run the sh command to build the image) ==> Do not forget the DOT in your command 

Docker list (request Jenkins to list the images available in docker) ==> sh " docker images" or sh 'docker image list' 

sh meaning in jenkins ==> you use sh to request jenkins to execute the command and if the exit code is = 0, the pipeline continues and is successful, then if the exit code
is > 0, the pipeline fails. 

Docker login (allow Jenkins’s login to your dockerhub account by creating pipeline syntax and saving the docker hub password as a SECRET TEXT). Do not forget to include the variable for the password. 

Avoid the following variable because ITS CONSIDERED insecure by jenkins 

$ PASSWORD

sh "docker log -u josh1991 -p $PASSWORD"

use variable like $BOOK, CAT, DOG, COW, etc

Docker push (push the created image to docker hub with the help of Jenkins) 

DEPLOYMENT STAGE - jenkins is going to deploy deployment manifest, and service manifest to the GKC

Have at least one of the below clusters: 

        GKC (Google Kubernetes cluster) – the best ==> cheapest 
        KOPS (Kubernetes operations) - aws ==> flat fee of $0.20 per hour on aws  
        EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Services)  ==> flat fee of $02.0 per hour on aws 
        KUBEADM (centos or ubuntu server on bare metal or on premise) 
        Linode cluster 

Kubernetes deploy with GKC, EKS, KOPS, KUBEADM (deploy both the (deployment and service manifests) with image created by Jenkins to the cluster)

Deployment manifest - springBootMongo.yml

Link to kubernetese deployment yaml file ==> https://github.com/joshking1/spring-boot-mongo-docker.git

Deploy manifest 

---
apiVersion: apps/v1 # for versions before 1.9.0 use apps/v1beta2
kind: Deployment  # name of the manifest 
metadata:
  name: huguette-dev # This is the name of the APP/pods 
  namespace: monitoring 
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: huguette-dev # The name of APP/pods 
  replicas: 1 # tells us the number of pods matching the template. In this case 1 pod/container/application
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate # bluegreen Canary deployement method 
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 1

  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: huguette-dev
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: huguette-dev
        image: nginx # This image will be given by the company 
        imagePullPolicy: Always 
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80 # This is the container port
Service 
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service # service manifest 
metadata:
  name: huguette-services # load balancer and also expose the pods to the user on internet
  labels:
    app: huguette-dev
spec:
  selector:
    app: huguette-dev
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
    - port: 80 # container port 
      targetPort: 80 # same as container port 
      nodePort: 31300 # the entrance door to the node where the pods are installed. The nodeport ranges from 30000 ro 32767
      
Final Stage 

Run the kubectl get deploy to verify the deployment of your manifest 

kubectl get deploy monitoring  

Run the kubectl get svc to verify the deployment of your load balancer
